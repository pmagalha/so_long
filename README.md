## THE LORE
<strong>Welcome to the imaginary dream world of EBA™!!</strong> (not really ™ :v)

EBA is a super super-hyper-mega cute friendly demon spawn, but she turns into a manace when hungry. Help EBA to find all the sushi pieces and escaping the claws of the evil blue hunger demons.

EBA satisfies her hunger with the little nigiris spread across the world. Her face turns demonic when hungry, and turns back to her original wobbly cuteness when fed.

Disclaimer: Any resemblance to my girlfriend or any other actual person is purely coincidental.

Be careful not to get caught by the evil blue hunger demons. EBA's stomach will turn outwards and she will vanish into hungry eternal oblivion.

## DISCLAIMER
At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written in accordance with the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school:

	- No for, do while, switch, case or goto are allowed
	- No more than 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file
	- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
	- No more than 5 variables in 1 function
 	- All the characters animations were done by me, frame by frame, using Photopea online.
  	- I may have taken a little longer than I needed on the animation part, but it was really fun. If you are short on time for the blackhole absorption, it would not be advisable to do the same.
